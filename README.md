## Project Summary

In this Kaggle competition we are given daily sales data provided by a Russian software firm (1C Company). The goal is to predict total sales for every product and store in the month following the last month present in the data. To accomplish this task I will be conducting time series analysis on the data and engineering features in order to develop a 1 month forecast of total sales. Results pending.
